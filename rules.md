# X-Team 103 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will be assigning tasks based on abailibility and experience with certain tasks. We will also be making a Slack channel to
communicate with the team. 

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Utilize the groupchat and let each other know when tasks are completed and what is to be completed next. Post 
progress to Slack. 

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Message the other team members and when applicable ask questions in lecture/office hour and communicate answers to
the rest of the team. 

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Send reminders in Slack and openly communicate deadlines and cross-check with other team members to make sure we are on time.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Be understanding and patient when working together. 
Have a clear understanding of tasks at hand so that we can be working towards the same goal. 
Don't be afraid to ask questions.
